<h1>James Jamerson</h1>
<h3>Edited by: Joy Yperlaan</h3>
<p>This is an assignment about html. To make it a bit more interesting, I added an image of the best bassist ever lived. Want to find out more about this bassist you wouldn’t find it <a href="http://www.buas.nl/">here.</a> However there is other stuff there.</p>
